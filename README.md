# Twitter Clone (Version 2)

I have already created a twitter clone before but that was when I was starting out with React. The code didn't look clean enough for me and it was very basic.
This version is a upgraded one, i'm using Tailwind and NextJs it works better and I have a better understanding than of React than I had when I started with
the first version.

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:astronomx/twitter-clone-v2.git

npm install
```

**Runnning project**
```

```
**Or**

```

```
